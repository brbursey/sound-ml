This will be a personal project for machine learning audio classification.

Still working on what to classify. Most likely will be classifying voice types into: 
- Bass
- Baritone
- Tenor
- Alto
- Mezzo-Soprano
- Soprano

More importantly, I want to focus on differnt architecture patterns for building machine learning products. This will start with:
- classifier service (Python)
- API wrapper (.NET)
- store models in AWS
- Amazon SQS to send requests to AWS
- docker
